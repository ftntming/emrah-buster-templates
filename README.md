About
=====

`emrah-buster` is an installer to create the containerized systems on Debian
Buster (_version 10_) host. It built on top of LXC (Linux containers). This
repository contains the `emrah-buster` templates.

Usage
=====

Download the installer, run it with a template name as an argument and drink a
coffee. That's it.

eb-gitea
-------------

Install a ready-to-use self-hosted Git service. Only AMD64 architecture is
supported for this template. Please contact me if you need eb-gitea for an
other architecture.

### Main components of eb-gitea

- [Gitea](https://gitea.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
- [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)

### To install eb-gitea

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emrahcom/emrah-buster-base/master/installer/eb
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emrahcom/emrah-buster-templates/master/installer/eb-gitea.conf
bash eb eb-gitea
```

### After installing eb-gitea
There is one more step to finish the installation. It's needed to fill
the initial configuration form of Gitea. Only two fields will be changed:
**SSH Server Domain** and **Gitea Base URL**.

Very easy!

- Access `https://<IP_ADDRESS>/install` to fill the Gitea config form.

- **SSH Server Domain**: Write your host FQDN or IP address. Examples:   
  *git.mydomain.com*   
  *123.2.3.4*

- **Gitea Base URL**: Write your URL. HTTP and HTTPS are OK. Examples:   
  *https://git.mydomain.com/*    
  *https://123.2.3.4/*

- Don't change the other fields. They are all OK.

- The first registered user will be the administrator.

### Customizing eb-gitea
Edit `/home/gitea/custom/conf/app.ini` file and restart the service to
customize Gitea. These are the customized settings of my private server.
See [cheat-sheet](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/config-cheat-sheet/) for more
details.

- PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY = lower,upper,digit
- FORCE_PRIVATE = true
- DEFAULT_PRIVATE = true
- DISABLE_REGISTRATION = true
- REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW = true
- DEFAULT_KEEP_EMAIL_PRIVATE = true
- [mailer] ENABLED = true
- [mailer] HOST = my-smtp-server.domain.com:587
- [mailer] FROM = emrah@domain.com
- [mailer] USER = emrah@domain.com
- [mailer] PASSWD = my-secret

eb-jitsi
--------

Install a ready-to-use self-hosted Jitsi/Jibri service.

Thanks to [Ave](https://ave.zone/) and [Fatih](https://www.fatihmalakci.com/)
for their support.

### Main components of eb-jitsi

- [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/)
- [Jibri](https://github.com/jitsi/jibri)
- [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)

### Before installing eb-jitsi
- Jibri needs `snd_aloop` kernel module, therefore it's not OK with the cloud
  kernel. Install the standard Linux kernel first if this is the case.

- It's needed a resolvable host address for your server and this address has to
  point to your server. Therefore add the DNS A record first if you didn't add
  yet. This host address will be used as `JITSI_HOST` in the installer config
  file.

### To install eb-jitsi

Download the installer

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emrahcom/emrah-buster-base/master/installer/eb
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emrahcom/emrah-buster-templates/master/installer/eb-jitsi.conf
```

Open `eb-jitsi.conf` file with an editor and change the `JITSI_HOST` value.

```bash
vim eb-jitsi.conf
```

Write the host address of your server as `JITSI_HOST`, save it and close the file.

```
export JITSI_HOST=jitsi.fortivoice-cloud.net
```

And run the installer

```bash
bash eb eb-jitsi
```

### Customizing eb-jitsi
You may want to change the following values in
`/etc/jitsi/meet/YOUR_HOST_ADDRESS-config.js`. This file is on the
`eb-jitsi` container, not on the host.

- startAudioMuted
- resolution
- startVideoMuted
- channelLastN
- requireDisplayName
- defaultLanguage
- disableAudioLevels

### Jitsi cluster
See [Jitsi cluster document](doc/jitsi_cluster.md)

Let's Encrypt support
=====================

To set the Let's Encrypt certificate, run the following commands on the host:

```bash
FQDN="your.host.fqdn"
set-letsencrypt-cert $FQDN
```

---

Requirements
============

`emrah-buster` requires a Debian Buster (_version 10_) host with a minimal
install and the Internet access during the installation. It's not a good
idea to use your desktop machine or an already in-use production server as
a host machine. Please, use one of the followings as a host:

- a cloud computer from a hosting/cloud service
  ([DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=92b0165840d8)'s
  droplet, [Amazon](https://console.aws.amazon.com) EC2 instance etc)

- a virtual machine (VMware, VirtualBox etc)

- a Debian Buster container (_with the nesting support_)
  ```
  lxc.include = /usr/share/lxc/config/nesting.conf
  lxc.apparmor.profile = unconfined
  lxc.apparmor.allow_nesting = 1
  ```

- a physical machine with a fresh installed
  [Debian Buster (_version 10_)](https://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst)
